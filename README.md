## Authorization Token ðŸ”’
To access the protected endpoints of the Book Catalog API, you need to include an authorization token in the header of your HTTP requests. You can obtain an authorization token by making a login request to the API.

Requesting Authorization Token
To request an authorization token, send a POST request to the API's login endpoint with your credentials. For example:

```json
POST /api/login/
{
  "username": "your_username",
  "password": "your_password"
}
```
If the credentials are correct, you will receive an authorization token in the response to your request.

## Using Authorization Token
After receiving the authorization token, include it in the Authorization header of your requests to the protected endpoints of the API. For example:

```json
GET /books/
Authorization: Bearer <your_authorization_token>
```

Be sure to replace <your_authorization_token> with the actual token you received when logging in to the API.
